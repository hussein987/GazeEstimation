UnityEyes is a application that generates synthetic but realistic eye images that are 
annotated with various pieces of information such as eye region locations and look vector. 
 
You can generate your own training images using the software which can be found at https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/rainbow/projects/unityeyes/

Please add your images to the `datasets/UnityEyes/imgs/` folder.

The `visualize.py` script contains some short examples of how to process this data with python, and was used to generate the image at the top of the page. Place this script in the same directory as the images.
